# Saiyans_paradise 
Here at saiyans pride we value the love and respect of any living being out there. Saiyans pride is a new collection that is dedicated to helping out autism research and any programs out there that are willing to help out this cause in any way. Our zombie team comes back from the dead and gives us a new way to study how the brain ğŸ§  s affected and how the body works after someone's death who has had autism. Join our undead research team as we do what we can to help out those in need.
